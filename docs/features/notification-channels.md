## Managing Channels

### Testing Channels
Always test new channels before using them for alerts. Click the **"Test"** button to send a test notification.

### Editing Channels
Modify channel settings by clicking **"Edit"**. You can update:
- Channel credentials/URLs
- Channel name/description
- Enable/disable status

### Deleting Channels
You can delete channels that are no longer needed. However, you cannot delete a channel if it's used by any active alert rules. Disable or update those rules first.

## Channel Status

Channels can have these statuses:
- **Enabled**: Active and will receive alerts
- **Disabled**: Paused, won't receive alerts
- **Error**: Last delivery failed (check configuration)

## Best Practices

### Multiple Channels
Configure multiple channels for redundancy. If one fails, others ensure you still receive notifications.

### Severity-Based Routing
Use different channels for different severities:
- **Info**: Email
- **Warning**: Telegram/Discord
- **Critical**: PagerDuty + Telegram

### Testing
Always test channels after setup and periodically verify they're working. Some services (like webhooks) may change URLs or expire tokens.

::: tip Recommended Channels
For critical alerts, use instant channels like Telegram or Discord. Email is better suited for informational alerts due to potential delays.

## Security

Keep your channel credentials secure:
- Never share bot tokens or webhook URLs publicly
- Rotate credentials if compromised
- Use separate bots/webhooks for different purposes
- Limit webhook endpoint access to known IPs if possible
